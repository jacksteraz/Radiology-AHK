# Radiology-AHK
## AutoHotKey script for radiologist workflow.
## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to help radiologists create useful AHK scripts to streamline their workflow. This project will aggregate examples of code found on the internet.
## Introduction
AHK can help reduce the number of keystrokes and button clicks that it takes you to read a case. It could potentially reduce the risk of repetitive stress injuries, increase productivity, reduce burnout.

Another reason to consider using AHK is that your practice might use several different PACS and dictation systems, each with its own set of keyboard shortcuts. With AHK, you can create scripts that will allow you to use the same button presses on every system that you use.

### Challenges
Locked down hospital computers. 

Solutions:
* Use the portable version of AHK 
* Purchase devices with programable onboard memory.
